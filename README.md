  Today I did the initial brainstorming and created the cover of my webcomic. I have decided to name it "Kiran",
  after a coding language I've made up.
  
    The main idea of the story is that our protagonist (no name yet) has enrolled in
    a computer science course to learn "Kiran". The projects given to him in class seem very weird, but no one else has
    a problem with them and just continue coding. He later finds out that the coding they are doing seems very familliar
    to that of a criminal on the loose, and that his teacher has been making them program scripts which uncover government information.
    His teacher turns out to be the sidekick of a druglord who has never been caught; a criminal who sells krokidil illegally, which can
    be a very lethal and harmful drug. 
    
  Perhaps I can make it so that the drug has been the cause of many strange deaths in the tristate area, and it's up to our protagonist
  to finally put an end to this. Maybe he can reverse the code somehow in order to make it reveal information about the location of
  the cartel, or where they may strike next.

  The very first pannel of my comic was completed today. I have decided to try and make one pannel minimun per day, so by the end of the
  semester I will have a couple of chapters. I don't intend on this web comic being very long, more of a short story type thing.
   
  I have also decided on names for some of the characters, which can be found on my *brainstorming* md.

  I've realized that i enjoy both writing and drawing, so I'm changing my project up a little bit to include both a written narrative and pictures. I have taken the idea from another web story I read online. I'm also doing this because it will be much easier to work on it in class since I don't need any of my art stuff.

I've started writing the first chapter of the story. I have also decided that with the help of HTML (and CSS), perhaps later on in the course, or when I learn more advanced things in CSS so that I can make better looking websites, I can make my own website for my story For now, I'm going to create a new file on my 20Time repo and work on my story from there.

I've begun to use and expirament on Bracket in order to make my HTML website for my story. So far I have the cover page down, and am trying to learn how to make it the background of the website. I've also added a bit more to my story today.

I started the first drawing for the story (other than the cover of course), which depicts Kinai in class with his friend, Dyrian.

The more and more I work on this project, the more I start to wonder if it's something I really want to do. I was very interested in my friend Anees's project, where he's making a game, and I saw a lot of the pixel art that went into making it. I think that there is a chance that I may change my project and decide to work on a game instead. I think that it may interest me more. Although I like writing, I find the coding part of the project more enjoyable than the writing.

I have now designed the main character for my game. He doesn't have a name yet, but I think he's pretty cute. I'm slowly learning how to
draw with pixel art on the website [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/). Here is his walking animation (sorry for the lag, the animation is much, much faster than that):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've begun the code for my game, using brackets. I think I'm going to stick to the main character still being named Kinai, because I really like that name. So far I think my game will be about a man's journey to becomming an all powerful being. I don't know the tiny details, but I'll figure that out once I actually begin to get a hang of coding movements and interactions with other elements in the game.

I ran into a few problems today while I was using Daniel Shiffman's code as reference. For some reason p5 doesn't register when I use keyboard inputs, so I'm going to have to work this issue out before I can continue.

October 31st , 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was able to figure out the movement AND make it better! Iv'e made it so that the character moves in that direction until the key is released instead of only once per key press. I haven't been able to get the image to load inside of the canvas, so I think i'm going to code the game without it for now.

I've begun to re-update my own repo for all of my work on the project. I need to improve my workflow, and I realise I have neglected my other repo until now. Any changes to the code and projects will be on there.

Added gravity and jumping into my game. The triangle can jump!

Worked on GitHub Pages this week - trying to find the best way to present all of my work on my GH profile. Also Installed Node.JS to help with my workflow! Helps me see changes in my code a lot better, and let's me work localy!

December 2nd, 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My next steps on my 20 time project are going to be to code in platforms that the character can jump over and around. I also want to make the gravity a little bit smoother in my game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've started working on my presentation in class. 
Things I need to think about/discuss:
1. What have I learned
2. What can I do as my next steps/with this knowledge
3. What was my experience (what did I have to encounter/face, what problems/solutions)

I need to make a 3 minute presentation, about 15 seconds per side. I can add a gif of my program and some ideas for the story line. I can also insert all of my code for the class to see. I'll make sure to reference my logs and my github aswell, to show the different stages of the project.
