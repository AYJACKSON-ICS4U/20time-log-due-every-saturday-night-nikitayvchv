  Today I did the initial brainstorming and created the cover of my webcomic. I have decided to name it "Kiran",
  after a coding language I've made up.
  
    The main idea of the story is that our protagonist (no name yet) has enrolled in
    a computer science course to learn "Kiran". The projects given to him in class seem very weird, but no one else has
    a problem with them and just continue coding. He later finds out that the coding they are doing seems very familliar
    to that of a criminal on the loose, and that his teacher has been making them program scripts which uncover government information.
    His teacher turns out to be the sidekick of a druglord who has never been caught; a criminal who sells krokidil illegally, which can
    be a very lethal and harmful drug. 
    
  Perhaps I can make it so that the drug has been the cause of many strange deaths in the tristate area, and it's up to our protagonist
  to finally put an end to this. Maybe he can reverse the code somehow in order to make it reveal information about the location of
  the cartel, or where they may strike next.

  The very first pannel of my comic was completed today. I have decided to try and make one pannel minimun per day, so by the end of the
  semester I will have a couple of chapters. I don't intend on this web comic being very long, more of a short story type thing.
   
  I have also decided on names for some of the characters, which can be found on my *brainstorming* md.

  I've realized that i enjoy both writing and drawing, so I'm changing my project up a little bit to include both a written narrative and pictures. I have taken the idea from another web story I read online. I'm also doing this because it will be much easier to work on it in class since I don't need any of my art stuff.

I've started writing the first chapter of the story. I have also decided that with the help of HTML (and CSS), perhaps later on in the course, or when I learn more advanced things in CSS so that I can make better looking websites, I can make my own website for my story For now, I'm going to create a new file on my 20Time repo and work on my story from there.

I've begun to use and expirament on Bracket in order to make my HTML website for my story. So far I have the cover page down, and am trying to learn how to make it the background of the website. I've also added a bit more to my story today.

I started the first drawing for the story (other than the cover of course), which depicts Kinai in class with his friend, Dyrian.

The more and more I work on this project, the more I start to wonder if it's something I really want to do. I was very interested in my friend Anees's project, where he's making a game, and I saw a lot of the pixel art that went into making it. I think that there is a chance that I may change my project and decide to work on a game instead. I think that it may interest me more. Although I like writing, I find the coding part of the project more enjoyable than the writing.

I have now designed the main character for my game. He doesn't have a name yet, but I think he's pretty cute. I'm slowly learning how to
draw with pixel art on the website [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/). Here is his walking animation (sorry for the lag, the animation is much, much faster than that):
